Question 1 [30 Marks]
Use ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet (Pre-trained models can be found online). Finetune the
model on X dataset for classification task and plot curves for training loss and training accuracy.
Report the final top-5 test accuracy. Perform the above task with any 3 optimizers from the
following list.
1. Adam
2. Adagrad
3. Adadelta
4. RMSprop
X = STL 10, if last digit of your roll no. is odd
X = CIFAR100, if last digit of your roll no. is even
In the report, analyze the results of each optimizer and mention the reason why one is better
than the other, or why not. Further, for each optimizer, you need to vary the value of attributes
and show its effect on the overall performance. Provide reasons for your observations in the
report. (For ex - In Adam you can change the values of attributes like beta_1, beta_2, epsilon,
momentum, weight_decay etc.)
