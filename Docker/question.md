# Question 1 [10 marks]
Implement a Neural Network using the IRIS dataset. Perform backpropagation using early
stoppping. You can choose the activation function and loss function at your convenience, which
gives the best performance.
The Neural Network should have 2 hidden layers, one with 4 neurons and one with 5 neurons.
The input layer should have 4 neurons and the output layer should have 3 neurons.
Report the test loss, test accuracy, train loss and train accuracy. The loss should be reported in
the form of curves.
Note - For today’s lab you can use docker in your local system. If you don’t have a GPU
then also it’s fine as the IRIS dataset is very small.
