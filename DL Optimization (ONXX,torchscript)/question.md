## Q1. Based on the lecture by Dr. Anush on DLOPs, you have to perform the following experiments :
● Load and preprocessing CIFAR100 dataset using standard augmentation and
normalization techniques [10 Marks]

● Train the following models for 50 epoch and at the same time profile the model using
Tensorboard during the training step [5*4 = 20 Marks]

1.ResNet-34

2.DenseNet-121

3.EfficientNet-B0

4.ConvNeXt-T

● Then perform the following model inferencing techniques on the above listed models
[10*2 = 20 Marks]

1. ONNX ; ONNX Quantized

2.Torchscript

● Report the model size and average execution time before and after performing the
above mentioned inferencing techniques on the test dataset [5*4 = 20 Marks]

Analyze the models based on their architecture and inferencing techniques and write them in
the report.
