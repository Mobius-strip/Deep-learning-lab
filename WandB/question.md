## Question 1 [100 marks]
Train a ResNet18 model for classification on even classes of CIFAR-10 (for students with even
roll no)/ odd classes of FashionMNIST (for students with odd roll no) for 30 epochs. Analyze the
training of model using wandb library and “weights & biases” tool covered in the class.

1) Show comparison of the performance of the hyperparameter tuning using plots using
the “weights & biases” tool. Hyperparameters: choice of activation function, optimizer
2) Write the observations about GPU (like GPU utilization, temperature etc).
3) Show all the logs about accuracy, loss using plots using “weights & biases” tool
4) Generate the report of the entire experiment using the “weights & biases” tool. Attach
this report to your assignment report.
5) Add a visual result analysis on the “weights & biases” tool taught by to Dr Anush, where
he shows the prediction for different images. Include this in the assignment video in
addition to the other demonstrations.
Note: The comparison should be done at least between 3-4 models (resulting from the choice
of hyperparameters)
