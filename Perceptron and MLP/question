Question 1 [4 Marks]
Implement a perceptron using the IRIS dataset. Perform backpropagation for two iterations.
Question 2 [6 Marks]
Implement an MLP using the IRIS dataset. Perform backpropagation for 15 iterations. The initial
weights of the MLP should be randomly initialized. You can choose the activation function and
loss function at your convenience, which gives the best performance.
The MLP should have 2 hidden layers, one with 4 neurons and one with 5 neurons. The input
layer should have 4 neurons and the output layer should have 3 neurons.
Note - The backpropagation should be implemented from scratch using NumPy, and the
use of inbuilt functions in PyTorch is not allowed for the same. Use of TensorFlow is not
permitted, and marks shall not be given for the same.
